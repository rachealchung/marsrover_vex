Hi!

You can find the final version of the code for the Mars Rover Robot (MRR) project.

The MRR project description can no longer be found on NYU Tandon's website; however, 
I uploaded a Final Design Report (FDR) that sums up the objective of the project, what we did, 
and how we built the rover. 

TL;DR: The final code and the FDR can be found in this repo.
